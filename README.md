# Tracer

Tracer is an asset tracker built using Ethereum smart contracts. Initially built as a concept to track gun ownership from manufacturer to seller to buy as part of a side project at Holberton School in San Francisco, it has been modified to be a generalized asset tracking system. 

Note: this project is simply an MVP. A real life implementation would have larger considerations. 

The concept is able to create an asset, assign it a unique ID, and transfer ownership from manufacutrer, dealer, and owner. Manufacuturers and dealers are identified by a flag for an Federal Firearms Liscence(FFL) to sell and distribute.

### Usage

Project utilizes a solidity IDE, Remix, in conjunction with Metamask, to test the concept using test ether. More information on these can be found at the websites below.
